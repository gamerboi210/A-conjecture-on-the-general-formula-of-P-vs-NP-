## Overview

This repository contains a **conceptual exploration** of a general formula for P vs NP.  

**Important Disclaimer:**  
- This is a **conjecture**, not a formal proof.  
- Built on pre-thought assumptions and a conceptual framework.  
- No claims are made regarding validity or provability.  
- Goal: provide a theoretical framework to aid future research and serve as a reference.  

## Scope

- Introduces a **General Formula (G)** representing all possible solution methodologies.  
- Explores **Conditional Subsets (C_P)**, activated only for specific problem instances.  
- Proposes a conceptual complexity class **NNP (Non-reversible NP)**, highlighting non-injective mappings where reconstructing the input is computationally infeasible.  

## Authorship & AI Disclosure

- All conceptual ideas, framework, and reasoning are **100% my own**.  
- AI was used **only** to refine language, improve clarity, and organize presentationâ€”not to generate the ideas themselves.
