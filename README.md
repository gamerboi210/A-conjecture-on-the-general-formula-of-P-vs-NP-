Overview

This repository contains a conceptual exploration of a general formula for P vs NP.

Important Disclaimer:

This is a conjecture, not a formal proof.

The paper is built on pre-thought assumptions and a conceptual framework.

No claims are made regarding the validity or provability of the ideas presented.

The goal is to provide a theoretical framework to aid future research and serve as a reference.

Scope

Introduces a General Formula (G) representing all possible solution methodologies.

Explores Conditional Subsets (C_P), activated only for specific problem instances.

Proposes a conceptual complexity class NNP (Non-reversible NP), highlighting non-injective mappings where reconstructing the input is computationally infeasible.

Notes on Authorship and AI

The conceptual ideas, framework, and reasoning are 100% my own.

AI was used only to refine language, improve clarity, and organize presentation, not to generate the ideas themselves.
